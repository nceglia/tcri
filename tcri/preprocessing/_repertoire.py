"""Summaries of a clonotype column, read before fitting.

Each function reads ``adata.obs`` and the clonotype derivation record in ``adata.uns`` and returns
a table. None of them filters cells, writes to ``adata`` or needs scirpy, and none returns a

    """Cells, clones and clone sizes per group, read before fitting.

    One row per group of ``groupby``, or per (group, covariate level) pair when
    ``covariate_key`` is given; ``groupby=None`` makes the whole dataset one group. A row exists
    for every group, or pair, that holds a cell with a clonotype. Within a row each distinct
    clonotype is one clone, so a clonotype that two groups carry is a clone in each, and a clone
    seen at two covariate levels is counted at both.

    Cells without a clonotype (NaN or None, an empty or whitespace-only string, or the string
    ``"nan"``) are left out and not counted; setup refuses them. A cell with no group, or no
    covariate level, is in no row. The function reads ``adata.obs`` and the clonotype derivation
    record in ``adata.uns``; it filters nothing and writes nothing to ``adata``.

    On a pooled column, one whose derivation record lists the pools it was written with, pools
    are counted in their own columns and not as clones. Their cells are part of ``n_cells``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        The object to summarize, fitted or not.
    clonotype_key
        The clonotype column of ``adata.obs``: a source column, a pooled column, or the column
        registered at setup.
    groupby
        The column naming each cell's group, usually the individual. ``None`` makes the whole
        dataset one group.
    covariate_key
        A column whose levels split each group into one row per level.
    phenotype_key
        A phenotype column; adds ``n_phenotypes_observed``.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        One row per group, or per (group, covariate level) pair, in the category order of each
        column as ``astype("category")`` orders it. Its columns:

        - the group, in a column named after ``groupby`` (with ``groupby`` only);
        - ``covariate``: the level of ``covariate_key`` (with ``covariate_key`` only);
        - ``n_cells``: the cells with a clonotype;
        - ``n_clones``: the distinct clonotypes among them, pools not counted;
        - ``n_singleton_clones``: the clones with one cell;
        - ``singleton_fraction``: ``n_singleton_clones / n_clones``, NaN in a row with no clone;
        - ``largest_clone_cells``: the cells of the largest clone, 0 in a row with no clone;
        - ``largest_clone_share``: ``largest_clone_cells / n_cells``;
        - ``n_phenotypes_observed``: the distinct phenotypes among the cells (with
          ``phenotype_key`` only);
        - ``n_pools`` and ``cells_in_pools``: the pools and their cells (on a pooled column
          only).

        Groups and covariate levels are strings.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        When a column is not in ``adata.obs``, or when ``groupby`` has the name of one of the
        summary's other columns.

    Notes
    -----
    How the columns bear on the metrics:

    - On the registered clonotype column, with ``groupby`` set to the metric's effective
      ``groupby`` (the one it is given, or the registered replicate when it is given none),
      ``n_clones`` of a (group, level) row is the clone count in the denominator
      :func:`tcri.tl.clonotypic_entropy` uses at that level when ``n_clones_ref`` is unset: the
      normalized value is the entropy divided by the base-2 log of that count. A row from
      ``groupby=None`` is an upper bound on every group's count, because :mod:`tcri.tl` resolves
      ``groupby=None`` to the registered replicate, while here it means the whole dataset.
    - Setting ``n_clones_ref`` to at least the largest ``n_clones`` across rows keeps every
      normalized value at or below 1.
    - A high ``singleton_fraction`` is where mutual information saturates at default settings.
    - A large ``largest_clone_share`` is also the symptom of sequence-cluster chaining in
      scirpy, where clonotypes defined by sequence similarity are joined through chains of close
      matches into one cluster.
